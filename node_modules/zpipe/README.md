# Z'PIPE!

zpipe is **not** a pipe.

!["Ceci n'est pas une pipe"](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg/300px-MagrittePipe.jpg "Ceci n'est pas une pipe")

>The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture "This is a pipe," I'd have been lying!

## About

zpipe exposes an interface to the [DEFLATE](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt) algorithm of the [ZLib](http://zlib.net/) compression library, it has been cross-compiled to JavaScript with [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

## Motivation

* Currently no compression API exposed in browsers
* Help users suffering from poor upload bandwidth

## Usage

Regular `<script>` include ...

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="zpipe.min.js"></script>

<script>
	var deflated = zpipe.deflate("the balloon");

	var inflated = zpipe.inflate(deflated); // "the balloon"
</script>
```

With require() ...

``` js
var zpipe = require("zpipe");

var deflated = zpipe.deflate("the balloon");

var inflated = zpipe.inflate(deflated); // "the balloon"
```
## Browser support

zpipe is supported in the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 7+ (**Note**: Use [zpipe-native](https://github.com/richardassar/zpipe-native/))
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

## Installation

Install the package with **npm**

    $ npm install zpipe

and bundle it with **Browserify**.

    $ browserify example.js -o bundle.js

Alternatively just add it to your **Ender** bundle.

    $ ender add zpipe

## But it's so big!

Ok 201 KB for `zpipe.min.js` is big, however it comes in at **57.6 KB** gzipped. This is acceptable.

## Tests

Test against node zlib bindings:

    $ make test

Run the test in the browser by pointing your browser to `test/test.html` and `test/test-native.html`.

## Character encoding

zpipe operates on octet strings only, multi-byte characters will have their high byte masked. If you want to handle multi-byte characters then you must convert your strings to UTF-8 prior to calling `deflate()` and then convert them back after calling `inflate()`

You could use [utf8](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/node-utf8) or [jshashes](https://github.com/h2non/jsHashes)' `Helpers.utf8Encode()` function for this, for example. 

## TODO

* Support stream compression through workers
* Benchmarks
